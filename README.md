# LARA

LARA is a novel cloud disk placement(CDP) policy. To implement LARA, we develop a prototype CDP system consisting of two modules, enabling offline training and online CDP determination.

This repository contains the following folders:

- src: The source code of our prototype CDP system.
- experiment: The code for our experiment.

Due to company confidentiality, we cannot open source the relevant data, so the repository does not contain the traces of CDs.
